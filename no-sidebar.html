									<h3>DISCRETE STRUCTURE</h3>
									<p>Embarking on the exploration of discrete structures within the realm 
										of computer science and mathematics has been an intellectually invigorating 
										experience, prompting profound self-reflection. Delving into topics such as
										set theory, logic, and graph theory has not only expanded my theoretical
										understanding but has also challenged the way I approach problem-solving 
										in a structured and rigorous manner. Learning about propositions, predicate
										logic, and proofs has fostered a meticulous mindset, urging me to
										scrutinize and articulate logical arguments with precision. The abstraction
										inherent in discrete structures has sharpened my analytical skills 
										and cultivated a deeper appreciation for the theoretical underpinnings 
										of computer science. This journey has underscored the interconnectedness
										of discrete mathematics with various aspects of computing, laying a
										solid foundation for algorithmic thinking and computational problem-solving.
										The reflective process has been integral in recognizing my evolving capacity
										to grasp abstract concepts and has instilled in me a sense of discipline in
										approaching mathematical reasoning and formal logic within the domain of discrete structures.</p>

										<h3>NILAI DAN JATI DIRI</h3>
									<p>Exploring my values and identity has been a reflective journey that has shaped 
										the core of my existence. As I've navigated through life experiences, personal beliefs,
										and cultural influences, I've come to understand the intrinsic connection between my 
										values and the construction of my identity. Unraveling the layers of what truly matters
										to me has not only clarified my moral compass but has also illuminated the guiding
										principles that govern my decisions and actions. The process has required introspection, 
										challenging societal norms, and discerning between values inherited and those consciously
										chosen. Recognizing the evolution of my identity in relation to shifting perspectives 
										and life events has been both enlightening and empowering. Embracing authenticity in 
										aligning my values with my actions has become a pivotal aspect of my selfhood,
										fostering a sense of integrity and purpose. This ongoing self-reflection has not
										only deepened my understanding of who I am but has also instilled a commitment to 
										continuous growth and alignment with values that resonate at the core of my being.</p>
