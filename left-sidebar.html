											<h3>IN-CLASS EXERCISE</h3>
											<p>Embarking on the journey of learning C++ programming techniques has been an enlightening experience, 
											fostering a deep sense of self-reflection. As I delved into the intricacies of this powerful programming language, 
											I found myself not only mastering syntax and algorithms but also developing a profound understanding of computational principles. 
											Through the trials of debugging and the triumphs of successfully implemented features, I've come to appreciate the importance 
											of patience and persistence in problem-solving. Self-reflection has allowed me to recognize areas of improvement, prompting me
											to seek out additional resources, engage in collaborative coding, and explore advanced topics. Moreover, the process of learning 
											C++ has instilled in me a greater appreciation for efficient code design, optimization, and the significance of logical structuring.
											This journey has not only honed my technical skills but has also shaped my approach to problem-solving and logical reasoning,
											fostering a continuous cycle of self-improvement and a genuine passion for the art and science of programming in C++.</p>

											<h3>ASSIGNMENT</h3>
											<p>Engaging in self-reflection on my journey to learn C++ programming 
											techniques has been a profound and enlightening experience. 
											As I delve into the intricacies of this powerful language, 
											I find myself not just acquiring technical skills but also 
											developing a deeper understanding of problem-solving and 
											algorithmic thinking. Each line of code becomes a canvas for 
											creativity and logical reasoning. In moments of triumph, when 
											a complex piece of code finally runs seamlessly, I celebrate
											not just the successful execution but the mental process that
											led to that point. Conversely, challenges and errors become invaluable 
											teachers, guiding me to reconsider my approach and refine my understanding.
											This reflective practice has not only enhanced my technical proficiency but also
											fostered a mindset of continuous improvement. It's a journey where every bug fixed, every 
										    algorithm implemented, and every concept grasped is a step forward in my evolution as a 
											C++ programmer and, more importantly, a systematic thinker.

											<h3>lAB EXERCISE</h3>
											<p>As I grappled with the intricacies of C++ syntax, object-oriented principles, and memory management, 
											I found myself constantly challenged and compelled to reassess my approach to problem-solving. The
											iterative nature of debugging and troubleshooting in C++ has not only honed my attention to detail
											but also instilled a sense of patience and perseverance. Each hurdle became an opportunity for 
											self-discovery, revealing not only gaps in my understanding but also the resilience needed to overcome 
											them. Through this process, I've come to appreciate the elegance and power of C++ as a programming
											language, and simultaneously, I've gained a clearer understanding of my own learning style and the 
											importance of adaptability in mastering complex technical skills. Self-reflection has become an indispensable
											tool in my learning arsenal, guiding me towards a deeper comprehension of C++ and fostering a mindset 
											that embraces continuous improvement.</p>
